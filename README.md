# I want to help Ukraine

> This project is an individual task in the course of the school of programming
> “HYF". The author chose the theme of the project to create a platform to help
> people in Ukraine and suffering from Russian military aggression. The platform
> will contain a description, contacts and accounts for donations to various
> organizations. All of them can be divided into three groups: assistance to the
> military, assistance to ordinary people and assistance to animals. The author
> is not an intermediary in the transfer of funds, he only provides information
> about real people and organizations that are really volunteers and help those
> in need in Ukraine.

## Instructions for use

Getting Started:

<!-- a guide to using this repository -->

1. `git clone git@github.com:HackYourFutureBelgium/template-markdown.git`
2. `cd template-markdown`
3. `npm install`

## Code Quality Checks

- `npm run format`: Makes sure all the code in this repository is well-formatted
  (looks good).
- `npm run lint:ls`: Checks to make sure all folder and file names match the
  repository conventions.
- `npm run lint:md`: Will lint all of the Markdown files in this repository.
- `npm run lint:css`: Will lint all of the CSS files in this repository.
- `npm run validate:html`: Validates all HTML files in your project.
- `npm run spell-check`: Goes through all the files in this repository looking
  for words it doesn't recognize. Just because it says something is a mistake
  doesn't mean it is! It doesn't know every word in the world. You can add new
  correct words to the [./.cspell.json](./.cspell.json) file so they won't cause
  an error.
- `npm run accessibility -- ./path/to/file.html`: Runs an accessibility analysis
  on all HTML files in the given path and writes the report to
  `/accessibility_report`

## Continuous Integration (CI)

When you open a PR to `main`/`master` in your repository, GitHub will
automatically do a linting check on the code in this repository, you can see
this in the[./.github/workflows/lint.yml](./.github/workflows/lint.yml) file.

If the linting fails, you will not be able to merge the PR. You can double check
that your code will pass before pushing by running the code quality scripts
locally.

## Repo Setup

- Give each member _write_ access to the repo (if it's a group project)
- Turn on GitHub Pages and put a link to your website in the repo's description
- Turn on GitHub Actions
- in the _Branches_ section of your repo's settings make sure:
  - The repository
    [requires a review](https://github.blog/2018-03-23-require-multiple-reviewers/)
    before pull requests can be merged.
  - The `master`/`main` branch must "_Require status checks to pass before
    merging_"
  - The `master`/`main` branch must "_Require require branches to be up to date
    before merging_"
